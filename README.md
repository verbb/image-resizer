Image Resizer is a Craft plugin that resizes your assets when they are uploaded. This allows huge images to be resized so as not to use up unnecessary disk space, but still kept at a reasonable resolution. This plugin is not a replacement for using image transforms throughout your site.

## Features
- Automatically resize your asset on-upload, or on-demand.
- Batch processing and element index action support.
- Non-destructive option to keep your original assets safe.
- Checks for resulting larger images first.
- Handy logging - check to see how Image Resizer has helped your assets.
- Unlimited use, free forever.
